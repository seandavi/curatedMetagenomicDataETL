## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** (code snippets, commands, etc.)
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and what you expected
- **Include your environment details** (Python version, OS, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users
- **List any alternative solutions** you've considered

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Make your changes following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) task runner - Command runner similar to make
- Google Cloud credentials (for BigQuery operations)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/curatedMetagenomicDataETL.git
cd curatedMetagenomicDataETL

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Verify installation
just --list
```

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
# See available commands
just --list

# Run individual components
just create-external-tables
just load-reference-tables

# Run the full pipeline
just run-etl-pipeline
```

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture and [USER_GUIDE.md](./USER_GUIDE.md) for usage examples.

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Code Quality

- **Clarity over cleverness**: Write code that is easy to understand
- **Document complex logic**: Add comments for non-obvious operations
- **Test your changes**: Ensure your code works as expected
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Include appropriate error handling

### Example Code Style

```python
def process_sample_data(sample_id: str, data_type: str) -> dict:
    """
    Process metagenomic sample data for a given type.
    
    Args:
        sample_id: Unique identifier for the sample
        data_type: Type of data to process (e.g., 'taxonomic', 'functional')
    
    Returns:
        Processed data as a dictionary
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If data_type is not supported
    """
    if data_type not in ['taxonomic', 'functional']:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported data type: {data_type}")
    
    # Process data...
    return processed_data
```

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Example:
```
Add support for new marker abundance table

- Implement parser for marker_abundance.tsv.gz files
- Add corresponding BigQuery schema
- Update documentation

Closes #123
```
